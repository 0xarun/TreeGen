# TreeGen

**TreeGen** is a cross-platform CLI utility that creates real folder and file structures from plain-text blueprints.
It supports tree-style, flat-style, and full-path formats, making it ideal for quickly scaffolding projects.
You can write your own structure file or generate one using ChatGPTâ€”TreeGen brings it to life in seconds.

## Features

- **Supports multiple structure formats:**  
  - Tree-style (with `â”œâ”€â”€`, `â”‚`, `â””â”€â”€` symbols and indentation)
  - Flat-style (directory, then files, no indentation)
  - Full-path style (e.g., `project/src/main.py`)
- **Handles nested directories and files**
- **Ignores comments and blank lines**
- **Creates empty files and folders as specified**
- **Cross-platform (works on Windows, macOS, Linux)**
